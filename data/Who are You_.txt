Who are You?
In the heart of Seoul, where the city’s vibrancy pulses through every street, there lives a man named Choi. Choi is a dedicated researcher, a son, and most importantly, a person who seeks to understand the mysteries of the mind, particularly the mind of his beloved father, David.
Choi grew up in a close-knit family where love was the foundation of every interaction. His father, David, was always the pillar of strength in the family. Though David was born and raised in the United States, he moved to Korea for work, where he met Choi’s mother, fell in love, and decided to make Korea his home. David was a man of wisdom, full of stories from his life in the States, stories that Choi never tired of hearing.
As Choi grew older, he found himself drawn to the world of medicine and research. He was fascinated by the brain and how it functioned, but it wasn’t until his father began showing signs of memory loss that Choi’s interest turned into a passionate mission. He watched as the man who once knew everything about him, who could recall every detail of their life together, slowly began to forget.
The diagnosis came as a shock to the family—Alzheimer’s disease. Choi couldn’t believe that his father, the man who had taught him so much, could be slipping away into the fog of this unforgiving illness. But instead of despair, Choi turned his grief into determination. He enrolled in medical school and specialized in neurology, dedicating his life to understanding Alzheimer’s and finding ways to combat it.
Years passed, and Choi became a leading researcher in the field. He was not just a doctor but a son on a mission. He knew that every breakthrough he made was not just for the countless patients suffering from this disease but also for his father, who was now a shadow of the man he once was.
